    <h2>Brief Introduction to the 7 Wonders</h2>
    <p>The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World were remarkable structures recognized by ancient Greek travelers for their size and beauty. Most were built in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions. Only one still stands today, but the rest live on through art, stories, and history. These monuments represent the creativity and skill of ancient civilizations. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>
    <p>This list was first written down by ancient writers and historians. They included only what they thought was most impressive and extraordinary. These wonders were landmarks of religion, culture, power, and engineering. Each reflected the culture that built it. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>

    <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu around 2560 BCE. It is the only ancient wonder that still stands today. It was the tallest man-made structure on Earth for nearly 4,000 years. Being made from more than 2 million stone blocks required incredible engineering without modern tools. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>
    <p>The pyramid was the largest of the three pyramids at Giza. The precise alignment and size show how advanced the builders were. It covered the pharaoh’s burial chamber and protected treasures inside. Though most of its smooth outer stones are gone, the pyramid’s core still remains. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</p>

    <p>The Hanging Gardens were said to be built by King Nebuchadnezzar II for his wife, Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills of her home. These gardens were described as terraces filled with trees, flowers, and plants. Water was lifted from the Euphrates River to feed the gardens. Whether they truly existed remains debated, but they were described by ancient writers. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</p>
    <p>If real, the gardens would have shown advanced engineering. They would have used irrigation to lift water to the top levels. This would make them one of the most impressive ancient garden designs ever. Even with uncertain evidence, they are remembered as a symbol of beauty and care. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</p>
